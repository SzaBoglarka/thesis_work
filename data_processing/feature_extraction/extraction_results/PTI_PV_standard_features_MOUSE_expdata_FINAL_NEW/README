PTI_PV_standard_features_MOUSE_expdata_FINAL had to be regenerated
so that the cell measurements with different protocols, and
the different number of parallel measurements from the cells
do NOT disturb the final feature results.
This is the new version. Use this one!

Changes:
The cell data folders were restructured in order to get proper feature results.
Cell measurements with different measurement protocols are now first processed separately.
The features from these cells extracted separately.
Therefore extraction results will be in different measurement folders.
E.g. in d190218_0102, d190218_0103, d190218_0104, and d190218_0105
This separation is crucial for the further processing steps.

As a next step, for these cells (d190218_01, r190531_02 and r190531_04)
from the measurement folders and measurement features.json we create
the cell's folder and the cells features.json file,
which contains the mean of the measurement feature values and there std-s.

As a last step, now that we have all of the proper cell folders and their features.json
file, we remake the overall features.json files using the data of each cell.
We create the corrected_features.json file from the proper cell feature values and their std-s.

In the following, use only this corrected_features.json file !
