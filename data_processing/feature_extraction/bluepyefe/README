extractor(old).py is the original BluePhyEfe standard features extractort
In the new version (extractor.py) I extended the code with a new part so that it can handle baseline current info as an input and 
create baseline_corrected standard currents and add it in the feature.json files 
if in the config file in the options the "correct_standard_currents_with_baseline_current" is set to True
(the defeault value is False)

The definitions of the standard current amplitudes were also updated. 
Now they depend on the firing frequency instead of the spikecount and 
the frequency thresholds of the standard currents can be set for the given cell type. 

Moreover, it this extended version can exclude bad traces from the extraction.

Nothing else is changed, just this plus info is added in case of every standard current
